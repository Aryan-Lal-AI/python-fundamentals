# Variables

This folder covers the basics of variables and data types in Python.

## Files
- `variables_intro.py`: Declaring and using variables of different types (int, float, str, bool).
- `data_types.py`: Using `type()` to check variable types and performing type conversions.

These scripts help build my foundation for understanding how Python stores and manipulates data.
