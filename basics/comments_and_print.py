# Hello again! These are comments! We can use them for personal notes
# For example this is my first and last name:
first_name = "Aryan"
last_name = "Lal"
# Now we are going to print our full name using an f string
print(f"Hello {first_name}")
print(f"Your last name is {last_name}")
# This was fun!
