# Basics

This folder contains my first Python scripts as I begin my programming journey.

## Files
- `hello_world.py`: My very first Python program â€” prints a greeting.
- `comments_and_print.py`: Practicing comments and print statements including formatting and my full name

These files represent my starting point in Python.
