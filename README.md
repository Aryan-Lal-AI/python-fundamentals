Python Fundamentals
Welcome to my Python Fundamentals repository!

I’m Aryan, a high school student passionate about AI and machine learning. This repo documents my journey learning the basics of Python programming, one step at a time.

About This Repository
Here you’ll find practice scripts, exercises, and mini-projects covering Python fundamentals such as:

Variables and data types
Control flow (loops, conditionals)
Functions and modules
Basic file handling
This is my personal learning space where I experiment, learn from mistakes, and build coding skills. All in code here is an expression of what I currently know and am practicing.

Goals
Create a solid foundation in Python programming
Prepare myself for more advanced projects in AI and machine learning
Set good coding habits, like having clean and well-documented code
Track my progress with time
How to Use This Repo
Go ahead and dig into the scripts, give the code a read and leave your feedback or suggestions. Im happy to work with others and learn from you!
